# Projen.io project type for generating Pulumi SDKs of Kubernetes CRDs

[Projen](https://projen.io) is a multi-language tool to automate the setup of a new project. 
It provides a consistent and opinionated way to bootstrap projects, manage dependencies, 
and enforce best practices across different programming languages and frameworks.

This project is specifically designed to generate Pulumi SDKs for 
Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), allowing developers to easily 
integrate custom resources into their Pulumi-based infrastructure as code projects.
